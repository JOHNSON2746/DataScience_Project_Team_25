## Project Overview
  This project aims to develop and validate a **methodology for intersectional data analysis** to uncover inequities within organizational employee data. By examining the intersections of gender, age, ethnicity, and education, the project supports evidence-based policy-making to foster workplace **equity and inclusion**.
  
## Objectives
 1.Identify which individual or intersecting characteristics contribute to inequity in the workplace.  
 
 2.Analyze organizational impact on:Salary、Career progression (recruitment, retention, advancement)、Working hours and conditions
   Training opportunities、Workplace culture (psychological and physical safety)  
   
 3.Develop synthetic datasets that resemble real-world company data.  
 
 4.Apply and validate the analysis methodology on: Public datasets (e.g. WGEA)、Synthetic datasets  

## Methodology  
**1.Data Analysis**  
Perform intersectional analysis using employee attributes such as:  
•	Gender  
•	Age  
•	Ethnicity (inferred from name/citizenship)  
•	Education level  
•	Evaluate how policies and procedures affect different groups.  

**2.Synthetic Data Generation**  
•	Create datasets mimicking a typical company’s employee information and internal practices.  

**3.Validation**
•	Test the methodology on WGEA and other public datasets.  
•	Apply it to synthetic datasets for generalized insights.
